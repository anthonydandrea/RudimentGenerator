# RudimentGenerator

RudimentGenerator will generate randomized music for snare drum. 

Different rhythms and combinations are probabilistically selected in such a way that is playable for a drummer.

Backend is a Dockerized Go HTTP service, which runs a Python script for generating a PDF.

Front end is React.
